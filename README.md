# yourDashboard
yourDashboard is a webbased dashboard engine written in PHP by Michael Batz. You can define multiple dashboards using a XML configuration file. Each dashboard consists of one or multiple dashlets, that will be reloaded in a configurable time interval using AJAX technology. yourDashboard comes with a few dashlets (for OTRS and OpenNMS), but it is easy to write your own dashlet, too.

This fork has some adaptions in design and some additional integrations for the DashletOtrsQueue
